<h1>The silent epidemic: a dive into domestic homicides in Spain</h1>

A case study of domestic violence in Spain since 2003, when national data started to be collected.
<br>
I have always been interested in researching the history of domestic violence in my home country, so for this project I looked at the different Spanish regions and 
calculated the number of viticms per 100,000 female inhabitants as well as the number of complaints per murder and how many women have actually made a police complaint before being murdered.

<h3>Data used</h3>

I used official data from the National Institute of Statistics (INE, in Spanish language) and the Ministry of Equity. 

<h3>What I learned</h3>

Actually it took me quite a fair amount of time to find the best way to visually show this story. Should I use absolute numbers of killings or was it better to 
show a percentage using the total population? Is it worthy to create a map or is there a more compelling, informative way to do this? 
<br>
I would say I have learned a lot about how to best visualize sensitive topics like killings or crime, as it can easily be misleading if we don't do it right. From a technical perpestive, I've also learned how to download and save multiple pdfs using tqdm and pathlib, and clean my QGIS and Plotnine visualizations with Adobe Illustrator.
